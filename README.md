# Abstruct
&emsp;&emsp;This project is a VR virtual museum project based on Unity and Pico. With the help of the real topographical map of Sanxingdui, we planned a special VR immersive museum exhibition with the theme of "Man and God: Sacrifice and Divine Cognition in Sanxingdui Culture". The aim is to let modern people understand the ancient people's examination and thinking about the relationship between human beings and gods through the simulation of the sacrificial scenes of China's Sanxingdui civilization, as well as their exploration of self-exploration. As well as their exploration of self-exploration. Through the virtual museum, we hope to popularize the cultural relics and culture of Sanxingdui, so that people can better understand the this civilization.
