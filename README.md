# Abstruct
&emsp;&emsp;This project is a VR virtual museum project based on Unity and Pico. With the help of the real topographical map of Sanxingdui, we planned a special VR immersive museum exhibition with the theme of "Man and God: Sacrifice and Divine Cognition in Sanxingdui Culture". The aim is to let modern people understand the ancient people's examination and thinking about the relationship between human beings and gods through the simulation of the sacrificial scenes of China's Sanxingdui civilization, as well as their exploration of self-exploration. Through the virtual museum, we hope to popularize the cultural relics and culture of Sanxingdui, so that people can better understand the this civilization.(DemoVideo:https://youtu.be/Dkqfabv9YPg)

# 1. Project Introduction
## 1.1 Background & Research
### 1.1.1 God and Man
&emsp;&emsp;The worship of God is one of the great divisions between man in the state of nature and man in the state of culture.The way to worship these deities is mainly to offer sacrifices and prayer through rituals, so that the deities will come down and pray for their protection or for their blessings to come down to the people.  
&emsp;&emsp;Sanxingdui artifacts are mainly used for rituals; humanfaced artifacts are transformed from human faces and morphed by incorporating imagery of the gods.

### 1.1.2 About Sanxingdui Museum
&emsp;&emsp;The Sanxingdui Museum is a large and modern themed archaeological museum in China. As a native of Sichuan, I have visited Sanxingdui more than once, and in the course of completing the project, I have also revisited and decided to select Sanxingdui Museum as the museum body and cultural carrier of my virtual exhibition hall.

### 1.1.3 About Process Of Sanxingdui Rituals
&emsp;&emsp;In the oracle bone divination records, the sacrificial activities of the Shang Dynasty people 3,000 years ago were conducted in a solemn and grand atmosphere.

## 1.4 Ideation
&emsp;&emsp;We have three main scenarios in the game.Below we've organized the design and narrative of the sub-scenario and the flow of the experience through a flowchart.

## 2.2 Modelling & Codding
### 2.2.1 Scene 1
&emsp;&emsp;The main functions completed are as follows：
- Modelling sand particle effects with particle systems
- Finishing a textbox guidance by using UI system
- Glow and sound when transforming between scenes
- We put the 3D modles we made into the scene
### 2.2.2 Scene 2
&emsp;&emsp;The main functions completed are as follows：
- We upgraded the project to URP for a more beautiful, realistic water effect
- Mini-map guide
- Movement of the boat
- Two alternative open-ended endings.One of the endings is to visit the ancient inhabitants and the other is to participate in the rituals
- Players can pass the ivory to the main Priest
